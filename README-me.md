## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

I must continue working on making things more responsive. This works on many devices but the CSS is a bit off for some screen sizes. Even though I added media queries for different sizes, at the end I focused mainly on the widths that the designed was made for (mobile around 375px and 1440px for desktop).
